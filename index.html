        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is AK Agarwal. I am currently a freshman at UC Riverside. 
        I have a lot of hobbies like creating music, playing sports, or writing out stories. I've been interested in 
        Computer Science ever since I was a little kid, when my love for video games started. As I played classic Nintendo 
        games like Super Mario Sunshine and Donkey Kong, I always had wondered on how these games were actually made. 
        As I grew older and older, I became more and more interested in the field of Computer Science. While I grew, my passions 
        for basketball and creating music had taken off, as I spent my time practicing and learning, but I still never lost that 
        wonder for Computer Science. Now that I am in the class, I am excited for what's to come and I look forward to a quarter of 
        coding!
        
        I also have a lot of experience as a student tutor. I have a lot of experience as I have been tutoring since I was a freshman in 
        high school. I tutor in English and Math, with Math being my strong suit. I tutor in subjects like Algebra 1, Algebra 2, 
        Trignometry, Statistics, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. I also have writing workshops and try to give younger students advice 
        for colleges.
        
        I am fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of studying. I consider myself a "forever student," 
        as I am always eager to both build on her academic foundations taking inspiration from school and life.
        I like to stay in tune with the latest developments in the news, as it provides insight for how I can improve by taking other people's perspectives.
        I look forward to always be better, whether that is through continued coursework and professional development.
        
        I consider myself a good public speaker, and I have a good sense of humor. I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player. 
        People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent communication skills. I love being social and
        being around people. I work well in teams, and am focused that everyone feels important in a team.
        
        I enjoy reading, and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my teaching skills and presentation abilities. 
        I do well in big groups, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. 
        This flexibility will help me in the classroom and the workplace, where there are many different personalities and learning styles.
        
        I also run my own business as a photographer. Having this business has taught me a lot of lessons. It's taught me how to manage my time, 
        and also how to work with customers. I learned that dealing with people are hard, as not only will they try to be unfair, but they'll also
        not be able to cooperate. Learning to overcome these obstacles has made me a better people-person, and given me the skills to deal with all
        types of personalities.
